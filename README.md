Project Guide
- I developed a word guess app for my special needs friend Braxton.
- I have loved working on this project. 
- All of my react code is in the App.js file. 
- If I were to do this project again I would spend more time preparing how I want to lay out my code. 
- Although my website isn't anything special, this is my first ever React project I have built completley by myself. And I feel much more confident in my abilities to build a react website.
- I know the code isn't pretty. In the next iteration I plan to refactor all of my code, but because I spent over 30 hours on this project I decided to call it. 
- Part of the hours I spent on this project was watching a tutorial. Because I didn't have any background in react development, I knew it would be much better if I spent some time watching a tutorial. 
- The web app should update the string you're trying to guess. 
- I included CSS transitions. That was the hardest part. But I got most of it working. 
- I also tried to explore new features in CSS and I did that by integrating different button features.
